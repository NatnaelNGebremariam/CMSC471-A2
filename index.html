            <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                Our visualization is based on a weather dataset containing over <strong>416,000 records</strong> from various weather stations across the United States.
                The dataset is provided by the NOAA Daily Global Historical Climatology Networkincludes important meteorological variables such as temperature
                (TMIN, TMAX, TAVG), wind speed (AWND, WSF5),precipitation (PRCP), and snowfall (SNOW, SNWD). The goal of this project is to explore relationships 
                between these variables and allow users to interactively analyze weather patterns. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our visualization is implemented using D3.js and presents a scatterplot. We explored alternative visualizations, such as line charts and bar graphs, 
                but ultimately chose a scatterplot due to its ability to depict correlations between multiple variables simultaneously.
            </p>
            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <p>
                Our Group had 3 members. Two of the group members were incharge of analyzing the data set and creating the scatterplot using D3 which took <b>10 hours.</b>
                The other group member helped with debugging, doing the write up on the webpage, and recording the demo video which took <b>2 hours.</b> We chose the
                NOAA weather data set because <b>there is a lot of information that can be extracted.</b> Before we started to code we know that for this particular data set we wanted the user to be able to <b>filter through stations and see the weather in all or specific states.</b>
                To design the scatter plot first <b>we gathered possible options users can make in order to filter through the data such as: "Station", "State" and etc.</b> Then <b>we made sure the user has a slider for the months</b> to allow the user to view very specific data. Our main challenges while developing the scatter
                plot was <b>organizing the data</b> we tried <b> to represent all the weathers orginially by state, but there was a issue of having data overlapping as the same state would have repeated or slightly different data</b> this alone took <b>5 hours to resolve.</b>  Some aspects that were rather straightforward to implement were 
                <b>the slider and dropdown menu</b> because <b>we were able to practice this feature during our labs.</b> If we were to do this project again we would change <b>the station dropdown by removing it, and allowing comparison of weathers between states </b> because <b> users would want to compare the weather between different states.</b>
                
            </p>

            <h2>How to Use This Visualization</h2>
